# Simple image deleter 
Done for practice and to help me delete all the duplicates and images I no longer want on my phone.

## Usage
Change the directory in the main function to the one you want to delete images from.

### Simple deletion
Go through every image in the directory and decide which ones to delete and which ones to skip. This is meant to be a quick way to view each image and decide if you want to mark it for deletion or not. Just press the respective key shown in console to mark or skip the current image. Inputs asking to be sure of your decision are made in console so be sure to change your focus to that window rather than the one showing the image.
